# useful-scripts


This repo is created for my [learning codes](https://github.com/chunjie-sam-liu/learning-codes). Most of scripts are created for bioinformaitc utilities, for example `download-*` scritps are used to download SRA and GSE data although this data can be downloaded through specific softwares like `fastq-dump` now. Afterwrads, some commands that I used often on Linux system, I compiled commands as `shell` or `python` scripts such as `generalParallel` and `killparallel`, and these scripts are used in my daily life.

`shadowsocks-*`, `jrocker` and `jukeras` are the scripts that aimed for restoration of working environment. `shadowsocks` is the well known software for scientific network. `shadowsocks-*` can be used to deploy the vss system. `jrocker` and `jukeras` are the scripts to use my docker image of `rstudio server` and `jupyter notebook`.
